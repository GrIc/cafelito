### AngularJS, HTML5, Java, Groovy and MongoDB all together - What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

This repository contains the code demonstrated at OSCON for the session with the title above.  The Git history is organised into the steps
as they were followed during the presentation.  By following the history you can see how the application is built up, 
including the final step that we didn't have time for, adding a button to the UI to display your nearest coffee shop (in the simplest way
possible).

[Slides are here](http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/i-want-coffeeoscon), including places to find further info about each of the 
technologies and techniques.

There are other branches in the repository which show alternative versions of the application, including using 
[MongoJack](http://mongojack.org) to talk to MongoDB instead of Morphia, and containing some of the additional steps we didn't have
 time for in this 40 minute session.
